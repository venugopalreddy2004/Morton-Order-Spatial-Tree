= Antora {cpp} Reference Extension

This extension generates reference documentation for {cpp} symbols in your codebase and creates an Antora module with its pages.

This extension populates the Antora pages with a reference module that contains the reference documentation for the {cpp} symbols in your codebase.

== Configuration

=== npm

Install this extension

[source,bash]
----
npm i -D @alandefreitas/antora-cpp-reference-extension
----

=== Requirements

Before building the Antora playbook, make sure you have the following installed:

- A {cpp} compiler (preferably Clang)
- `7z` (Windows) or `tar` (Linux)
- `git`

=== Playbook

Append the following in your `playbook.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: '@alandefreitas/antora-cpp-reference-extension' # <1>
      dependencies: # <2>
        - name: 'boost'
          repo: 'https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git'
          tag: 'develop'
          variable: 'BOOST_SRC_ROOT'
          system-env: 'BOOST_SRC_ROOT' # <3>
----

* <1> `npm` package name: `@alandefreitas/antora-cpp-reference-extension` (required)
* <2> List of dependencies to be downloaded and extracted. The directory where these dependencies are extracted will be available to all components as an environment variable.
* <3> The name of the environment variable describing where the path can be found. If this path exists and is a valid directory, it will be used as the source root for the dependency, skipping the download and extraction steps. If this is different from `variable`, the extension will set the value of `variable` to the path where the dependency is already located.

Besides the `dependencies` configuration, you can also set the following options:

|===
| Option | Description | Default

| `version` | A semver range that specifies the version of MrDocs to use. | `*`
| `allow-master` | If `true`, the extension will allow the use of the `master` branch for MrDocs if `version` is `*`. | `true`
| `allow-develop` | If `true`, the extension will allow the use of the `develop` branch for MrDocs if `version` is `*`. | `true`
|===

=== Components

Components that will include reference documentation should set the path of the MrDocs configuration file. Append following in your `antora.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
ext:
  cpp-reference:
    config: doc/mrdocs.yml # <1>
----

* <1> The path to the MrDocs configuration file relative to the worktree.

For more information about MrDocs, see https://www.mrdocs.com/docs

=== References in the component

To include links to the reference module, the prefix `xref:reference:` should be used.

You would usually include a link to the main reference page in the component's `nav.adoc`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:reference:index.adoc[Reference]
----

== Example

The `example` directory contains an example project with a component that uses the extension.
